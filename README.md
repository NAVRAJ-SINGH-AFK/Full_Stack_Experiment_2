📖 Overview

This repository serves as a centralized hub for Experiment 2, demonstrating the power of native web technologies. The project is segmented into three distinct 

modules, each tackling a specific challenge in real-time user interaction.

🧪 Core Modules

1. Live Character Analytics (Exp 2.1)

Purpose: Monitors user input in real-time to provide immediate feedback.

Technical Focus: Leveraging the input event listener and DOM manipulation to update the UI without page refreshes.

2. Intelligent Product Filter (Exp 2.2)

Purpose: A dynamic sorting system for product catalogs.

Technical Focus: Utilizing CSS Grid for responsive layouts and JavaScript array methods to handle conditional visibility based on dropdown selections.

3. SVG Vector Canvas (Exp 2.3)

Purpose: A browser-based drawing tool for creating vector graphics.

Technical Focus: Capturing low-level mouse events (mousedown, mousemove) to programmatically generate and append SVG elements to the DOM.
